# IBM-Data-Analytics-Capstone
## Project Overview

This is a capstone project for the IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. I used my data collection, data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and programming skills to solve a real-world business problem.

## Business Problem
The problem is that we do not know the probability of a successful flight due to the number of variables that affect the flight of the first stage.

It attempts to answer the following questions:

1. What are the factos behind the success and failure of a flight?
2. What is the probability of a successful landing based on the data gathered?

Data must be collected from SpaceX's launches to determine the probability of success.

## Data Sources
The data sources that I will be using for this project are from

- Wikipedia
- SpaceX

## Data Analysis
I will use the following data analysis techniques to solve the business problem:

- Exploratory data analysis with visualization (using the matplotlib and seaborn libaries) and SQL (IBM Db2 and SQLAlchemy)
- Data wrangling
- Creating interactive visual analytics with Folium and Plotly Dash
- Perform predictive analysis using classification models

## Results
The results of my analysis should identify the factors that influence the success or failure of a flight. The findings will be presented in a powerpoint presentation. 

## Tools
The tools used are:

- Python
- IBM Db2
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook
- Github
